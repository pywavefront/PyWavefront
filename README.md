Jonas: modified syntax to be python 3 compatible

PyWavefront
===========

This python module allows you to read Wavefront 3D object files
(`something.obj` and `something.mtl`) and use them as Python objects.
Currently Pyglet is required to render and display these objects.

Currently, only a subset of [the defined
specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) has
been implemented.

Requirements
------------

* [Pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/)

Usage
-----

### From Python

    import pywavefront
    meshes = pywavefront.Wavefront('something.obj')
    meshes.draw()

### Example Script

A pyglet example script with included `.obj` and `.mtl` files is
included in the `example` directory. To run it, change to the `example`
directory and run `./pyglet_demo.py`.

### Generating a Wavefront file with Blender

The following presumes you are using [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) to generate your mesh:

* Using Blender, create a mesh with a UV-mapped texture. The UV-mapping is important! If it is working properly, you will see the texture applied within Blender's 3d view.
* Export the mesh from Blender using the Wavefront format, including normals.
* Reference your `*.obj` file as in the pywavefront example above.

Installation
------------

### Source distribution

Assuming you are in the top-level PyWavefront directory:

    python setup.py install

### Pip

    pip install PyWavefront

Tests
-----

All tests can be found in the `test` directory. To run the tests:

* Install nose: `pip install nose`
* Change to the top-level directory, e.g. `PyWavefront`, the directory that contains this `README` file.
* Run `nosetests`

ChangeLog
---------

## 0.1.1
